# Still a work in progress
- Based on [easy_ViTPose](https://github.com/JunkyByte/easy_ViTPose/)
- Objective: easier to use and more flexible interface for ViTPose
- This repo is not for training, only for inference (for now, at least)
- CoreML model added respect to the original repo

## TODOs
- [x] Add support for video, webcam inference
- [x] Turn this model into a package and add distribute it to PyPi
- [x] YOLO like apis for inference
- [x] Check if TensorRT backend is better without the use of pycuda


## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lum1t4/vitpose_extra.git
```
